# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
### The purpose:
##### PyBer Analysis challenge uses Jupyter to commit different lines of code to pull specific data from  both city_data and ride_data files to produce a table summary and graph that can give an over all veiw of the ride fare and driver fare within Urban, Suburban and Rural areas. This is done by extracting different pieces of the information such as the total drivers, rides, total fare, and the average fares for each of the city types. With this, a table can be made with clear summarization that outlines the different factors by city type. The second deliverable is focused on creating the a line graph that tracks the weekly fares of each city over the course of four months. By using functions like groupby(), index, pivot and loc I was able to exacute lines of code that properly produced the information

## Results:
### Deliverable 1 Results
### Ride-sharing data among the different city types:

* Rural: The table reveals that the average fare per ride and per driver is the highest within rural city types. However, it was the lowest in total rides, drivers, and total fares. 
* Suburban: This city type had the secong highest average fare per ride and driver below Rural along with the second highest amount in toal rides, drivers and fares after Urban city types.
* Urban: This city type had the most total rides, drivers and total fares out of the city types, however, it also had the lowest average fare per ride and per driver

### Deliverable 2 Results:
### Total Fare by City Type

* This data deliverable captures the total fare by city type on a weekly basis over the course of 4 months.
*  As shown on the graph below, it can be seen that Rural cities have the lowest total fare that barely exceeds 500 $USD. 
*  Suburban is mostly stangnet in the middle with two small peaks in the month Feruary and April, however, it does not exceed 1500 $USD. 
*  Lastly, Urban has the highest weekly total fares maintaning in the  1500- 2500 $USD range through out January and April.

## Summary:
#### Business Recommendations 
##### The business recommendations to the CEO for addressing the disparities among the city types are as follows:

* I would reccomend that they hire more drivers in Rural areas. I think that because there are less driver and rides available the average fare to get a ride is very high. This of course could also be because the demand for drivers in a rural area are not as needed as drivers in cities, but this would close the wage gap numbers wise. 
* There are many drivers and rides available in the city which make them less in demand and cheaper to pay. The driver's wage is significantly low, alomost 7 dollars less than those in rural cities. I think that the CEO should distribut these drivers to other areas instead of concentrating them in urban cities. 
* Suburban cities are a good example of how the numbers could reflect across all of the cities without significanlty cutting the drivers pay or increasing the amount for a ride. If the total drivers and rides avaible are distributed more evenly, there would be less of a financial disparity across the board for drivers and riders.
